## What is Metabase?

Metabase is an open source business intelligence tool. It lets you ask questions about your data, and displays answers in formats that make sense, whether that's a bar chart or a detailed table.

Your questions can be saved for later, making it easy to come back to them, or you can group questions into great looking [dashboards](./07-dashboards.md). Metabase also makes it easy to share questions and dashboards with the rest of your team.
